<p>Megadeth was given the opportunity to tour with Aerosmith on the 1993 Get a Grip tour, which promised to be a pretty awesome experience. Aerosmith had already been around for decades, and they were known for being outrageous party animals. Pretty much everything you'd think a metal band like Megadeth would want in some tour mates, and that may have been true, but Megadeth didn't get much of a chance to find out before Aerosmith dumped them from the tour in favor of the band Jackyl.
